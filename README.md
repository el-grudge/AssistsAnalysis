# AssistsAnalysis

In soccer, the most valuable players are those who score the most goals. However, goalscorers on their own can't do much, they need someone to provide them the ball so they can score. In this analysis I'll look at those providers, the playmakers. It could be argued that assisting is harder than scoring, since it involves picking out a player in space, deciding whether the receiver wants the ball at his feet or ahead of him (if he is making a run behind defense), and doing all of this while under pressure from the opponent's defenders.

I'll be using data provided by statsbomb, a soccer analytics company. Specifically, I'll be looking at the English women's league since the start of the 2018/19 season. During this period, there have been 383 assisted goals (some goals are not assisted, such as those coming from set pieces, like penalty kicks).
